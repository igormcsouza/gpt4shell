### Issue: Failing GitHub Actions Job

The current GitHub Actions job in the `release.yml` workflow is failing due to attempting to push changes while in a detached HEAD state. This issue needs to be addressed to ensure that commits and pushes are successful.

### Suggested Fix:
1. Update the checkout step to use `ref: main`.
2. Add a command to check out the main branch before pushing changes:
   ```yaml
   - name: Checkout main
     run: git checkout main
   ```
