### Issue: Failing GitHub Actions Job

The current GitHub Actions job in the `release.yml` workflow is failing due to attempting to push changes while in a detached HEAD state. This issue needs to be addressed to ensure that commits and pushes are successful.

### Root Cause
The workflow checks out a specific release tag (e.g., `refs/tags/v0.1.0.2`) which creates a detached HEAD state. When the workflow tries to commit and push version changes, Git fails because you cannot push from a detached HEAD state.

### Fixed Solution:
1. ✅ Added a step to checkout the main branch before committing changes
2. ✅ Updated the push command to explicitly push to `origin main`
3. ✅ Added safeguards to handle cases where no changes need to be committed
4. ✅ Added `git pull origin main` to ensure we have the latest changes

### Changes Made:
- Modified `.github/workflows/release.yml` to checkout main branch before version commits
- Added proper error handling for cases where version is already up to date
- Ensured the workflow pulls latest changes before pushing
